## How to Use

### For Users:

1. Look for the language switcher button in the top-right corner of the header
2. Click it to switch between English and Urdu
3. The entire interface will instantly update to the selected language
4. When Urdu is selected, the layout automatically switches to RTL
5. Voice recognition will work in the selected language

### For Developers:

#### To add new translations:

1. Add the English text to `src/i18n/locales/en.json`
2. Add the Urdu translation to `src/i18n/locales/ur.json`
3. Use the translation in your component:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return <p>{t("your.translation.key")}</p>;
}
```

#### To access current language:

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

function MyComponent() {
  const { i18n } = useTranslation();
  const currentLanguage = i18n.language; // 'en' or 'ur'
}
```
